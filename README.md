# Machine Learning Algorithms Analysis
#### This repo is used mainly for implementing machine learning algorithms and comparing algorithms implemented from scratch (`numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn`) and using Python Libraries (Tensorflow).   
  
#### The data used here will be stored in `data` folder and is comprised of two main dataset: bitcoin value (for numerical analysis) and global cars values (classification analysis). The analysis will be implemented in `src` folder and contain the name of algorithm, which consists of a readme.md for algorithm explanation (simple algorithm and example) and analysis report and two other folder : Scratch (Python using Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) and Complex (Python using Tensorflow). Each folder will have its equivalent c-style file that has been converted into C++ for production and will be tested using Google Colab run feature and also each folder will consist of one file that will implement the algorithm.  
  
#### This repo is made in effort to ~~make myself understand and a reminder in the future~~ give a better understanding how these algorithm implemented and ultimately be used for a reference for those who seek knowledge or is lost in learning it. Made with love <3
